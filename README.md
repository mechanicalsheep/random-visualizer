Random Visualizer
An idea to visualize random numbers and chances in js.
Visualizes random nodes being chosen. every 2 seconds a random node will be selected. This random node also has a random "death weight" which is the chance that the node will "die" if chosen. You can bet on which node you think will be the last node standing.
